    <p class="message">
      happy girlfriend’s day, baby.<br>
      i honestly don’t even know where to begin because words will always fall short when it comes to you.<br>
every single day with you feels like a gift i never knew i deserved.
you make my world brighter, my heart lighter, and my life so damn beautiful.<br>
there’s something about the way you laugh, the way you care, the way you love so deeply it just melts me.<br>
you turn the smallest moments into magic.<br>
when i am with you, i feel at home. like everything finally makes sense.
you have held my hand through storms and danced with me in the sunshine, and i will never stop being grateful for you.
you make me want to be better, love harder, and never take a second for granted.<br>
i don’t know what i did to deserve you, but i swear i will spend my whole life making sure you feel loved, safe, and adored.
thank you for being mine, for loving me the way you do, and for being the most beautiful part of my story.<br>
you are everything, baby. absolutely everything.<br>
i love you.<br> forever and always.<br>

      <h2>For You 💌</h2>
      <p>
       you walked in like sunlight<br>
       quiet, warm, and bright,<br>
       and suddenly, my world<br>
       was no longer just black and white.<br><br>
       you turned the noise into music,<br>
       the chaos into peace,<br>
       every hug from you<br>
       feels like a soul’s release.<br><br>
        your smile is my morning,<br>
        your laugh, my favorite sound,<br>
        i was lost in the dark<br>
        and somehow, you were found.<br><br>
        you don’t just love,<br>
        you heal,<br>
        you don’t just stay,<br>
        you feel.<br><br>
        you have seen every crack<br>
        and called it art,<br>
        you have held every ache<br>
        like it was part of your heart.<br><br>
        i don’t need a thousand wishes,<br>
        i just need you near<br>
        my love, my calm,<br>
        my reason, my dear.<br><br>
        you are the poem i will write<br>
        for the rest of my days,<br>
        and i will love you forever<br>
        in a million quiet ways.
